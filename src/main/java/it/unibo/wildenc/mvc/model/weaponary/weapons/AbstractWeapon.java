/**
 * Abstract class for a Weapon. This is done because ALL weapons share these things:
 *  - Different weapons shoot different types of projectiles, so the weapon has the information needed to generate
 *    that specific kind of projectiles;
 *  - All weapons have a "cooldown": they won't attack at every moment, but an attack will happen some time after
 *    the last one;
 *  - Preventing the creation of copies of the same weapon for different types of projectile, the name of the weapon
 *    changes based off the type of the projectile it shoots (i.e. if SomeWeapon shoots some FIRE projectiles its name
 *    will be "Fire Attack", if it shoots WATER it will be "Water Attack", etc...). Also, the type of the projectile
 *    doesn't change how the weapon works, but its appearance in game.
